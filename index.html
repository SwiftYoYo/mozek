    <h2>Preface</h2>
    <p>This website aims to function as a temporary guide for living, in order to test for benefits. There will be commandments which must be followed that aim to alter how one lives both personally and socially and punishments that will incur if one fails to follow the commandments. There will also be my personal record on results and a discussion of how certain commandments were created, appended or removed. There will also be an archive of all of my essays written, but please do keep in mind that they are written in the pursuit of improving metacognition and articulation and can therefore be fairly biased or false, but when does one not ridicule their past self?</p>
